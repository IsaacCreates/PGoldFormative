      <h1>Functionality</h1>
      <p>
        One key element of most fitnes apps is that they are easy to use and easily implementable in ones daily routine. 
        This results in a minimal starting hurdle to provide an easy start when first using the app.
        The apps collect the users' data by requesting inputs, the smartphone sensors, and having wide compatibility with health gadgets like smartwatches.
        One key aspect is the setting of goals. Whether it is losing weight, gaining muscles, or wanting to be able to run longer.
        Most apps allow the users to set goals which is a central element in keeping motivated throughout the training.
        Using this data the app provides the user fitting training plans to ease one into their first training or further enhance their fitness.<br/>
        <br/>
        Many apps also provide users with fitting nutrition plans that are healthy and make it easier to reach one's goals.

      <h1>Results</h1>
      <p>
        Healt and fitness apps are a great way to become/stay healthy and get some extra motivation for each workout.
        Especially in times of corona where doing sports is not easy and some sports aren't possible, these apps can have great impacts on everyone's wellbeing. 
        The possibility to share the results and virtually train with and against friends give an additional feeling of community and competition.
        There is hope for great results since already over 52% of smartphone and smartwatch owners in the US use such apps. (5)
        <br/>
        <br/>
        A study showed: <br/>
        "Nearly three-quarters of current app users reported being more active compared to under half of non-users and past users. The IPAQ showed that current users had higher total leisure time metabolic equivalent of task (MET) expenditures (1169 METs), including walking and vigorous exercise, compared to those who stopped using their apps (612 METs) or who never used apps (577 METs). Importantly, physical activity levels in domains other than leisure time activity were similar across the groups. The results also showed that current users had lower BMI (25.16) than past users (26.8) and non-users (26.9) and that this association was mediated by exercise levels and self-efficacy. That relationship was also moderated by perceived barriers to exercise. Multiple serial mediation models were tested, which revealed that the association between app use and BMI is mediated by increased self-efficacy and increased exercise." (6)
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This shows that such apps are a great inexpensive way to enhance the fitness of many people.
